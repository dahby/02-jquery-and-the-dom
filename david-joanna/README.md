# jQuery and the DOM

**Author**: Joanna and David
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are given a collection of blog articles however inside one data string. Our goal is to create objects for each article inside the aray and pass this information from rawData file. Then we use this information to append into the DOM using jQuery syntax. On the top of that we calculate the information on how many days since the posting date has passed. We want to dynamically populate the blog so the user could find the most recent blog articles first.

## Getting Started
1. Define the array.
2. Build the constructor function.
3. Create the the objects and push it into the array.
4. Clone the HTML properties.
5. Append the values of the properties into the HTML.
6. Calculate the 'days ago' and sort articles by most recent.
7. REmove the article template from HTML and add .template into CSS to display:none.


## Architecture
For this project we used HTML, CSS, JavaSrcipt and jQuery.
